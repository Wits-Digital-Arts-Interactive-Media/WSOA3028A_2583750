                <h3><u>Goal Alignment</u></h3>
                <p>To showcase my portfolio of projects to potential collaborators and employers, whilst learning the fundamentals of web development. Users should be able navigate the website with ease and view what they want within 3-clicks</p>
                
                <h3><u>Information Structure</u></h3>
                <p>When the website is opened it will display the home page. On which will be the main heading for the website and the navigation section. In the centre of the screen will be a small paragraph about what the user can expect from the website
                  The navigation section will consist of the names of each document ie blog posts, about page, design. When the player clicks on these it will take them to the relevant document.
                  On each document there will be a hyperlink to send the player back to the homepage.
                  </p>
                
                  <h3><u>Interface Elements</u></h3>
                  <p>My navigation for site consists of <b>hyperlinks</b> stating the section of the site. Example, an <b>unordered list</b> element named "Portfolio" will be a hyperlink that the user may click on, which will take them to the portfolio document, displaying my works. There will be other hyperlinks in bodies of texts relating to something of interest that I may have seen and wished to include. The inspiration websites are image elements that are also hyperlinks that when clicked on, will take the user to the specific website. When the user’s cursor is hovered over the image a tooltip will be shown. <b>Alt text</b> is also available for browsers that do not handle the image file types</p>
                
                  <h3><u>Design Research</u></h3>
                  <p>Naturally, I found my website following the Hick’s law for user experience. <b>Hick’s Law</b> states that the <i>time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices</i>. My website is fairly simple to navigate and understand. Few options are provided to the user, which simplifies their choices and allows them to feel in control. <b>Positional memory</b> is used also with the navigational items, as it is common convention for the website navigation to be at the top. In terms of alignment, font and colour use, I will have to experiment and research what fits best for the website and what need to change in the structure.</p>
                
                  <h3><u>Reflection</u></h3>
                  <p>I have tried to maintain using simply html for website 1 and not getting ahead of myself with CSS and Javascript. For me personally, I prefer to take my time to digest one language before going to next so it does not become convoluted for me. One of the aspects I struggled with was the semantic markup and ensuring the markup is appropriate and the code remains readable. I noticed the semantic mark-up can make your scripts look more complex then they actually are and I am trying to avoid that whilst ensuring I am using them correctly. Designing the wireframes and mapping out user flow has also been a challenge to me as, design and art is not at the forefront of my skillset, however by following the guidelines and examples I believe they are improving. 
                    I am proud of how I have grasped the language, albeit a simple language it has been a more straightforward learning path compared to learning C#. My blog posts I believe have improved from week 1, to be more concise and in line with the modules, theories and coursework provided. Going forward, I will look to add styles such as fonts, colours and adjust the alignment so that is provides a better user experience and perhaps adjust the structure of blog posts to be more organised.
