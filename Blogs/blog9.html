            <h3><u>Incorporating JavaScript</u></h3>
            <p>
                My navigation was initially comprised of html markup that used hyperlinks to send the user to the chosen page. The navigation system is now entirely javascript. The menu is generated based on an array containing the various pages of my website. The script selects the “nav” portion of my index.html script within my header and automatically generates the menu within the nav. I used a similar method to create an index for all the blog posts on my website, allowing the user to navigate to each blog post 
At the end of each blog post in the footer section of the document there are two buttons: previous and next. This allows the user to navigate to the blog post immediately before or after the current blog post. The content of the blog posts can be long and require the user to scroll far enough down, until they cannot see the main navigation menu, therefore having buttons to assist traversing blog posts helps with user experience. 
On my home page, there is a small animation of a meme cat faced that uses javascript to get the transform of the image and rotate it, adding for some comedic effect. My portfolio page displays my previous works such as games and in the future I may choose to include some javascript practice programs. Currently, it only contains games and each game has its own slide with a description of the game. In the footer there are buttons that display to the user forward and backward. Allowing the user to navigate through all the games made.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><u>Streamlining Design</u></h3>
            <p>
                The javascript additions makes the website more functional and efficient. For example, I could have added my portfolio similarly to how the design section was completed or the blog posts but having the user scroll all the way down and then all the way up again is not feasible and comfortable, therefore adding buttons to navigate around assists on improving the user experience.
