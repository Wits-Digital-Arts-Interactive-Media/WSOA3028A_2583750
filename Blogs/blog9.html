            <h3><u>Incorporating JavaScript</u></h3>
            <p>
                My navigation was initially comprised of html markup that used hyperlinks to send the user to the chosen page. The navigation system is now entirely javascript. The menu is generated based on an array containing the various pages of my website. The script selects the “nav” portion of my index.html script within my header and automatically generates the menu within the nav. I used a similar method to create an index for all the blog posts on my website, allowing the user to navigate to each blog post 
                At the end of each blog post in the footer section of the document there are two buttons: previous and next. This allows the user to navigate to the blog post immediately before or after the current blog post. The content of the blog posts can be long and require the user to scroll far enough down, until they cannot see the main navigation menu, therefore having buttons to assist traversing blog posts helps with user experience. 
                On my home page, there is a letter animation that transitions between my aspiring titles "Game Developer" an "Front-End Developer".This was done using both JavaScript and CSS styling. My portfolio section makes use of JavaScript and CSS to create image sliders for each game in my portfolio. A screenshot of the game is set to the background with information about the game displayed above it. When the user clicks on a different game card, the slide and the information will fade out until the new slide and information for the selected game fades into the screen.  

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A similar approach was taken to display the wireframes and IxD planning for the website. Each wireframe is given its own "card" with a description explaining the wireframe beneath it. Collectively, the wireframes are set up in a carousel container so that only a few a present on screen and when the user clicks next, the next set of wireframes loads onto the screen. </p>
            <br>
            <h3><u>Streamlining Design</u></h3>
            <p>
                The javascript additions makes the website more functional and efficient. For example, I could have added my portfolio similarly to how the design section was completed or the blog posts but having the user scroll all the way down and then all the way up again is not feasible and comfortable, therefore adding buttons to navigate around assists on improving the user experience. 
                Blocking off certain sections of the wireframes enables the information is not too compact and difficult for the user to read. The user is able to view the wireframes, read the respective description and navigate to the next set of wireframes with ease. 

                The portfolio is the core focus of the website. Future employers or job prospectives will focus on this aspect of the website to get a look at your previous projects. The porfolio section of my website does not split the attention between the different projects but rather each project that is selected becomes the centre of attention. Screenshot of the project takes the focus and becomes the background image with a description on top of it. Navigating between the other projects are simple as well. The cards are displayed and the user simply has to click on it. Within the footer, is a hyperlink to my Github page and Itch.io page, this supports the portfolio of the website and takes the user to the respective page directly.
