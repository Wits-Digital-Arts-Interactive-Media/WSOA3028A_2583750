                <h2><u>Reading Reflections</u></h2>
                <h4>Reading:Graham et al. - 2015 - Towards a study of information geographies</h4>

                <p>
                    Information Geographies refers to the geographic distribution of information production, analysis and consumption. By studying information geographies, it allows us to gain insight into many other analytics such as patterns of access, participation and representation. Augmentations are overlays of information onto geographical areas, thus creating “Immutable Augmentations”. These are overlays  that are consistent and therefore provides persistent information about an area

                    Information geographies paints a picture not only the digital information of an area but also the power dynamics, politics and economic. For example, in an area with unstable governance and poor service delivery will result in low economic growth and less provision of services such as internet and therefore lead to low digital information accessibility from that region.

                <h4>Reading: Spyros Kasapis : Internet Access as a Fundamental Right </h4>

                <p>
                    In this new digital age that the world is rapidly evolving into, access to the internet and its capabilities is widely starting to be seen as a human right. According to the UN, “The UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, in his 2011 report to the UN Human Rights Council emphasized that "without Internet access, which facilitates economic development and the enjoyment of a range of human rights, marginalized groups and developing States remain trapped in a disadvantaged situation, thereby perpetuating inequality both within and between States".[6]” This led to widespread debates and arguments on grouping internet access along with basic utilities such as water and electricity and for governments to ensure their citizens have universal access

                    Without affordable or universal access to internet, the disadvantaged and economically poorer people are separated from the markets. The coronavirus pandemic highlighted this gap, as those without internet were shut off from the online markets that were flourishing during the pandemic.

                <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                <p>
                    As an aspiring web dev in South Africa, it is crucial that we are aware of the challenges posed by the lack of access to these services. South Africa is currently the most unequal country in the world. This can be seen across many spheres that the information geography provides. The map below shows how South Africa’s broadband network is distributed across the country and we can notice how it is concentrated around the major economic players such as Gauteng, Cape Town and Kwazulu natal. To my surprise, according to the map we have made great in roads into the rural areas of Limpopo, North West, etc, however there is still much to do within areas such as Northern Cape and Eastern Cape. Affordable internet access to these disadvantaged areas promotes entrepreneurship and education on the digital space and can be used to improve on aspects of our country such as unemployment and population under the poverty line. By encouraging digital education and entrepreneurship it opens the market to more people to participate on the web and uplift themselves.
