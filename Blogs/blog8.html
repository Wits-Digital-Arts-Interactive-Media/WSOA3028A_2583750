                <h2><u>Reading Reflection</u></h2>
                <h4>Reading: Christoph Lutz : Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and Big data</h4>

                <p1>
                    Digital inequalities tend to mirror existing social inequalities in terms of socio-economic status, education, race, gender, employment etc. Lutz breaks down three levels of digital divide

                    <dl>
                        <dt>Access to digital technologies</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This refers to unequal access to internet and ICT technologies. Whilst national access to internet has increased, we still face a challenge of providing for people in rural areas, or people from a low income bracket. As mentioned this digital inequality mirrors social inequalities.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Digital Skills</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This second level now shifts attention from accessibility to capability. This level explores how individuals engage with the technology they have. In order for the second level to occur, the first must be bypassed and as such we can assume that there is access to some digital technologies, yet an issue persists on if the people know how to use said technology. 
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Technology Use</dt>
                        <dd>The third and final level describes if users are able to use their technology skills to translate into real world     assets in an economic, social or political form. This level considers the implications of technology from an advantageous  and disadvantageous point of view</dd>
                    </dl>

                    Lutz argues that the ever progressing landscape of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies will exacerbate already existing digital inequalities When a new technology enters the market, skilled ICT users will be able to learn how to use the program in a quicker span compared to someone who is inexperienced with ICT. For example, when ChatGPT was released to the public, it took myself a few days to understand how it works and a few weeks to understand the prompt engineering needed to get a satisfactory result. However, ChatGPT may be a foreign product to someone from an older generation or someone from a less experienced background with digital technologies. These are inequalities that may arise from age or economic/social backgrounds.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Lutz draws the importance of studying the implications of the algorithmic decision making and suggests including digital inequalities studies with algorithmic studies and therefore better understand how these systems shape social inequalities
