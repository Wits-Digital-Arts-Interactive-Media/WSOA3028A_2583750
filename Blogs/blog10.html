            <h3><u>CSS, HTML and JavaScript Relation</u></h3>
            <p>
                The color palette and styles I've chosen for my website reflect my preference for minimalism and subtlety. I am not a big fan of bright and flashy colors so by utilizing a range of black and greys with simple, clean lines, the design avoids flashiness and instead focuses on delivering content in a straightforward and unobtrusive manner. This approach aligns with my personality, as I prefer not to draw excessive attention to myself but rather opt for the simple and efficient method. The design focuses on clarity and functionality, mirroring my belief in the elegance of simplicity.

The CSS used integrates the html markup and javascript to create a cohesive and polished experience for the user. The HTML provides a clear structure with appropriate use of semantics and microformatting to assist with styling. The sections , articles and content for the blogs and wireframes are organized for easy readability. The CSS then enhances this structure by applying styles that reflect my aesthetic, such as muted colors, simple fonts, and smooth transitions. These styles ensure that the content is visually appealing without being overwhelming. Additionally, the JavaScript adds interactivity, such as the intersection observer for animations, which is supported by CSS transitions to create a fluid and engaging experience as users scroll through the page and view different portfolio works.

            <h3><u>Responsive Design</u></h3>
            <p>
                In our modern world that has become so intertwined and connected with technology and the web, responsive design ensures that websites we build and use provide an optimal experience across a range of devices such as automatically adjusting the layout to fit different screen sizes. Responsive design also optimises search engine optimization of search engines and browsers such as google.

            <h3><u>Decolonising Coding Practices</u></h3>
            <p>
                In the context of decolonialism, we have to approach coding practices with a mindful and inclusive mindset. This involves using language and terminology that are inclusive and avoid reinforcing stereotypes or biases. Representation and diversity are also key considerations, both in the examples we use in coding tutorials and in the staff of developers. Accessibility and usability play a vital role, urging us to design code and interfaces that are accessible to people with diverse abilities and needs, while prioritizing user experience for all
