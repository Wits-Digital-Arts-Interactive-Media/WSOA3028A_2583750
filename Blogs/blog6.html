            <h3><u>Digital Equality</u></h3>

                Equality in the digital realm must take into account the political, social, cultural and economic aspects in society. These are the most common drivers of inequality in our world and as such we must learn what mistakes to avoid from them when advocating for digital equality. We see a common pattern that digital inequalities tend to be exacerbated in regions of high societal inequality, that being economic or social, as such it is logical to propose that solutions to the inequality drivers can assist in solving digital inequality. However, digital equality is not necessary higher in "developed countries", for example if we compare the pricing of 1GB mobile data in the world, the most expensive currently is Zimbabwe ($43) but one of the cheapest is Cambodia($0.12), according to a UK <a href="https://www.cable.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/">service provider</a>. So we can see here that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Public policy seems to be behind the developing and fast tracking key decisions that facilitates the addressing of these issues and mitigation against exclusions and divisions in the digital space.

            <h3>Addressing Digital Inequality</h3>
            <p>Tackling digtal inequality is a complex task that requires the cooperation of both the private and public sectors. <b>Infrastructure</b> needs to be built in rural areas to firstly provide the network needed to connect to the internet via broadband or fibre. <b>Internet plans</b> must be made affordable through government subsidising costs to ensure low income households can purchase these plans. Once these households are connected to the internet, digital literacy becomes essential to knowing how to use the internet and the various devices it is connected to and making full use of the potential of the digital economy</p>
                <br>

            <p>In South Africa, there is a massive digital divide that is a result of the persistent wealth-gap in the society. This gap is shown when looking at the percentage of households with access to internet across the different provinces. In provinces, that are more developed as a result of the presence of businessess and wealthy individuals, the access to internet in public is more substantial, as well as the access to internet at home. Whereas in provinces that have been neglected and have a large portion of rural areas, the access to internet in public and at home is relatively low.

            <h3><u>Digital Inclusion</u></h3>

                Digital inclusion is defined as the ability of individuals and groups to access and use information and communication technologies. Despite the mass production of these technologies, digitization is not occurring equally around the world and as the internet begins to shape our daily life and wellbeing, digital exclusion can be seen as a source of poverty, as such fast tracking  digital inclusion could aid in the upliftment of many regions around the world. It begins by providing access to technologies and internet services, along with the necessary education and training to improve the digital literacy. Affordability and Inclusivity can be assisted with in civil society, such as affordability of products and public wifi and services. Digital inclusion should ensure that regardless of background and circumstances, everyone has a fair opportunity to participate within the digital landscape.
