            <h3><u>Digital Equality</u></h3>

                Equality in the digital realm must take into account the political, social, cultural and economic aspects in society. These are the most common drivers of inequality in our world and as such we must learn what mistakes to avoid from them when advocating for digital equality. We see a common pattern that digital inequalities tend to be exacerbated in regions of high societal inequality, that being economic or social, as such it is logical to propose that solutions to the inequality drivers can assist in solving digital inequality. However, digital equality is not necessary higher in "developed countries", for example if we compare the pricing of 1GB mobile data in the world, the most expensive currently is Zimbabwe ($43) but one of the cheapest is Cambodia($0.12), according to a UK <a href="https://www.cable.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/">service provider</a>. So we can see here that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Public policy seems to be behind the developing and fast tracking key decisions that facilitates the addressing of these issues and mitigation against exclusions and divisions in the digital space.

            <h3><u>Digital Inclusion</u></h3>

                Digital inclusion is defined as the ability of individuals and groups to access and use information and communication technologies. Despite the mass production of these technologies, digitization is not occurring equally around the world and as the internet begins to shape our daily life and wellbeing, digital exclusion can be seen as a source of poverty, as such fast tracking  digital inclusion could aid in the upliftment of many regions around the world. It begins by providing access to technologies and internet services, along with the necessary education and training to improve the digital literacy. Affordability and Inclusivity can be assisted with in civil society, such as affordability of products and public wifi and services. Digital inclusion should ensure that regardless of background and circumstances, everyone has a fair opportunity to participate within the digital landscape.
