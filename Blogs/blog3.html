        <h3><u>Content of Site</u></h3>
        <p> "User alignment" refers to how the elements and content of a webpage are positioned based on the preferences of the user and the intentions of the developer. How an element is aligned can communicate the intentions of the developer to the user in a manner the developer sees appropriate. For example, a heading would typically be centered on the webpage to clearly indicate to the users that this is the focal point and what they should pay attention to. For my website, the directory and navigational links will be near to the top of the page, as this is what the user identifies first. Content of each page will consist of text and image elements. Paragraphs that require the most attention will be centred to provide focal attention . Hyperlinks to external websites of note will be included with a title or name that is appropriate and not misleading. For each page that the user can access, they will be able to navigate out of it and return to a home page. The below wireframe, annotate how each page is mapped out and how each element on the page will be within the path of the user in order</p>

        <h3><u>Structure of Site</u></h3>
        <p>
          The focal point of the website will be displayed in the centre to gain focus and attention, whilst the other sections will be displayed near the top, spaced equally. The user should not have trouble navigating through the website, and finding what they want to should have minimal effort. If they wish to view the portfolio, it should be a maximum of 3 clicks away. The content should not be overwhelming to the user and should be organised for a seamless experience. The <b>3-click rule</b> guides developers in user experience. If accessing something takes more than 3-clicks then it is an inconvenience to the user and should be improved. The below wireframes diagramtically displays how each section adheres to the 3-click rule.

            title="Mapping Overview of Website">

         </figure>


        <h3><u>Semantic Markup</u></h3>
        <p>In terms of semantic markup, the website should contain elements that are friendly and accessible to users with disabilities that are using assistive screen readers. These help assisted users to understand the website and its content and have minimal difficulty navigating through it. Semantic tags provide context about the content they enclose for humans and aids search engines and bots such as crawlers to understand the structure and meaning of the webpage. Semantic tags can cause the webpage's code to become convoluted to developers and make it difficult to read and understand. </p>
