    <h3> GitHub </h3>
    <p1> GitHub is an absolute <b>nightmare</b> for me, definitely one of my goals before the end of the block is to be comfortable with GitHub and its functionality. Its impossible to not notice the strengths of having a github repo and having the skills to manage it as it helps immensely when it comes to group projects and organising. Many of my group members from last year know that I struggle with understanding how to use its capabilities due to a VERY rational fear that it will override something important and will be lost in the eternal void never to be found again. That was my experience when using GitHub for unity games, so far, using it in interactive media has also proved a challenge to be honest, but it is something I can learn by playing around with and having the occasional visit to stack overflow.</p1>
  
    <h3> Weekly Readings </h3>
    <p2>The reading I selected for the week was <b>The Library of Babel</b> by Jorge Luis Borges. I will be honest and say that it was a dense reading, personally, however I did enjoy the vivid and hyper-detailed descriptions present within it. It felt similar to walking through a labyrinth with no end from a science fiction point of view. How it relates to interactive media and the internet is that it replicates the feeling of the world wide web. It is endless and infinite and yet anything can be found.
      
      I did attempt the reading about <b>hypertext</b> by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, however what was discussed in said reading was far above my current level to make sense of it.</p2>
  
    <h3> History of The Web</h3>
    <p3>While completing the module. We learnt about the history of the internet and the world wide web and how it came to be. Initially began by CERN the world wide web was a place used to store and access research papers and academia, hence it was primarily used by researchers or government. Since then, it exploded into what it is now. Similar to how it is hypothesized that the big bang was an explosion that created the universe and has since been expanding non-stop, so has the internet. Whilst still able to perform its uses to academia that is now just a miniscule of its current capabilities. The research stored on the web itself has evolved from only being in text form to now taking shape in videos, podcasts, short image posts with captions, etc and it will continue to evolve with time. </p3>
  
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p4>My goals for the course is to become proficient in the multiple programming languages available to us and to use it has a basis to learn more in the future to create a wider and diverse portfolio of projects and learn about the dev industry, not necessarily relating to games about also web and software. In the short term, I would like to be able to learn the languages in a consistent manner and become comfortable with anything Git related.  </p4>

    <h3> Folder Structure</h3>
    <p1> While my website starts taking shape, the initial folder structure will comprise of the index page, which will have a small introductory paragraph, detailing what the website content will be. The index page will also contain hyperlinks to the blog document and an about document. The blog document will contain the content for the weekly blogs. I will probably divide each blog post into their own document, to make it more user friendly and organised. The about document will contain brief description of myself. The folder will also contain an image folder to contain any images I use within my document. If I have an idea to use other forms of media such as gifs or videos, they will also be contained in a separate folder so that it is organised and easier to access. A design folder will be created to display wireframe ideas and IxD documentation. Other than our website assignments, we will also have essays to complete, these essays will be displayed in its own document. Finally, the portfolio section will showcase the games I previously created.</p1>

    <h3>URL Scheme</h3>
    <p2>URL means <b>Uniform Resource Locator</b> and is the given address for a resource on the web. Each URL has is a unique resource. The first part of the URL is known as the protocol and it indicates to the browser which protocol must be used to transfer data around the computer network. Google now displays an icon to view website information for the user to know if it secure or not and allows the user to access the valid certificate. It also allowa users to view settings on the site's cookies. Semantic URLs are designed to be human-readable, rather being in the broswer's space it is placed in the users. This website will be  hosted on Github Pages, which takes the files from our repo, publishes it and it is hosted on the <i>github.io</i> domain. As it is hosted on Github, the security is automatically handled and the site with have an https protocol and :443 port, followed by the name of the organisation and domain(wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io) and my own repo and the path file (WSOA3028A_2583750/index.html). All together the URL will appear as <a href="https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2583750/index.html">https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2583750/index.html</a></p2>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p3> My aim with the initial wireframes is to create a website with a simple and basic outline that allows me to understand how html elements can be used. As my knowledge of html and other languages develop, so to will the wireframes and the conceptual ideas for the website. For now, the homepage will appear similar to the wireframe below. The About page and Essay page will have the same layout, as both documents will be primarily text based. The Portfolio and Design Pages will have layouts that compliment the visual elements it will consist of.

      The above websites are simple yet effectively communicate the intention of the host to the users. Navigation on the websites are made particularly accessible to the user. There is less conflict between their input and the desired output. I chose these as inspiration, as I feel my current design philosphy is based on user convenience- making the website easy for the user to feel in control of what they are doing. I've seen many websites, that stray too far away from conventions and while it makes for a great spectacle and artwork, the user is confused on how to navigate and find what they need.

      <h3> Reflections on module</h3>
      <p5>The reading for this week regarding hypertext was very dense for me. It took a few readings and research for me to understand and so I still feel I don't fully have a grasp on it. One of the standout points, was the discussion on the potential for hyperlinks to change narrative structures. We see today how narratives on the internet are conveyed, especially with a new platform such as TikTok, which has created entirely new sub genre's of content on the internet. Moulthrop spoke about the idea of <i>"retrieving what was previously obsolesced"</i>, which refers to the revival of preservation of artefacts. We see on the internet how sites such as Google or Youtube allows us to access and preserve content or archives from years ago.
      Coincedentally, I found this <a href="https://roguereader.blogspot.com/2010/11/some-rough-notes-on-stuart-moulthrops.html">blog post</a> which helped with my understanding of some of the content of the reading
      <br>

      <p6>Interaction is the basis of the world wide web. Billions of interactions occur on a day-to-day basis on the web, between other users and between users and applications.Interaction is the response of something from a user’s input. How the user interprets the information provided to them and how they choose to interact with it. In web development terms, the user engages with the application with the intention of finding something and in turn the application must provide the necessary information to the user in a concise manner. A weakness that is found in certain websites, is that it caters to the developers needs and not the users. The developer forces the user to adapt to the website's interface, when the user should have no struggle in figuring out the website and the website should cater to the user's needs instead.

        <h3>Content of Site</h3>
        <p1> "User alignment" refers to how the elements and content of a webpage are positioned based on the preferences of the user and the intentions of the developer. How an element is aligned can communicate the intentions of the developer to the user in a manner the developer sees appropriate. For example, a heading would typically be centered on the webpage to clearly indicate to the users that this is the focal point and what they should pay attention to. For my website, the directory and navigational links will be near to the top of the page, as this is what the user identifies first. Content of each page will consist of text and image elements. Paragraphs that require the most attention will be centred to provide focal attention . Hyperlinks to external websites of note will be included with a title or name that is appropriate and not misleading. For each page that the user can access, they will be able to navigate out of it and return to a home page. The below wireframe, annotate how each page is mapped out and how each element on the page will be within the path of the user in order</p1>

        <h3>Structure of Site</h3>
        <p2>
          The focal point of the website will be displayed in the centre to gain focus and attention, whilst the other sections will be displayed near the top, spaced equally. The user should not have trouble navigating through the website, and finding what they want to should have minimal effort. If they wish to view the portfolio, it should be a maximum of 3 clicks away. The content should not be overwhelming to the user and should be organised for a seamless experience. The <b>3-click rule</b> guides developers in user experience. If accessing something takes more than 3-clicks then it is an inconvenience to the user and should be improved. The below wireframes diagramtically displays how each section adheres to the 3-click rule.

        <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
        <p3>In terms of semantic markup, the website should contain elements that are friendly and accessible to users with disabilities that are using assistive screen readers. These help assisted users to understand the website and its content and have minimal difficulty navigating through it. Semantic tags provide context about the content they enclose for humans and aids search engines and bots such as crawlers to understand the structure and meaning of the webpage. Semantic tags can cause the webpage's code to become convoluted to developers and make it difficult to read and understand. </p3>

<h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
<p1>To showcase my portfolio of projects to potential collaborators and employers, whilst learning the fundamentals of web development. Users should be able navigate the website with ease and view what they want within 3-clicks</p1>

<h3>Information Structure</h3>
<p2>When the website is opened it will display the home page. On which will be the main heading for the website and the navigation section. In the centre of the screen will be a small paragraph about what the user can expect from the website
  The navigation section will consist of the names of each document ie blog posts, about page, design. When the player clicks on these it will take them to the relevant document.
  On each document there will be a hyperlink to send the player back to the homepage.
  </p2>

  <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
  <p3>My navigation for site consists of <b>hyperlinks</b> stating the section of the site. Example, an <b>unordered list</b> element named "Portfolio" will be a hyperlink that the user may click on, which will take them to the portfolio document, displaying my works. There will be other hyperlinks in bodies of texts relating to something of interest that I may have seen and wished to include. The inspiration websites are image elements that are also hyperlinks that when clicked on, will take the user to the specific website. When the user’s cursor is hovered over the image a tooltip will be shown. <b>Alt text</b> is also available for browsers that do not handle the image file types</p3>

  <h3>Design Research</h3>
  <p4>Naturally, I found my website following the Hick’s law for user experience. <b>Hick’s Law</b> states that the <i>time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices</i>. My website is fairly simple to navigate and understand. Few options are provided to the user, which simplifies their choices and allows them to feel in control. <b>Positional memory</b> is used also with the navigational items, as it is common convention for the website navigation to be at the top. In terms of alignment, font and colour use, I will have to experiment and research what fits best for the website and what need to change in the structure.</p4>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p5>I have tried to maintain using simply html for website 1 and not getting ahead of myself with CSS and Javascript. For me personally, I prefer to take my time to digest one language before going to next so it does not become convoluted for me. One of the aspects I struggled with was the semantic markup and ensuring the markup is appropriate and the code remains readable. I noticed the semantic mark-up can make your scripts look more complex then they actually are and I am trying to avoid that whilst ensuring I am using them correctly. Designing the wireframes and mapping out user flow has also been a challenge to me as, design and art is not at the forefront of my skillset, however by following the guidelines and examples I believe they are improving. 
    I am proud of how I have grasped the language, albeit a simple language it has been a more straightforward learning path compared to learning C#. My blog posts I believe have improved from week 1, to be more concise and in line with the modules, theories and coursework provided. Going forward, I will look to add styles such as fonts, colours and adjust the alignment so that is provides a better user experience and perhaps adjust the structure of blog posts to be more organised.
