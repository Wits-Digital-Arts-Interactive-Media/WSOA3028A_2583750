                        <p>This wireframe depicts the planning for the home page. In it we can see the main heading for the website, followed by a navigation tab that will allow the users to view each section of the website. On the homepage, there will be a small introductory paragraph so that users will know what to expect. At a later point, previews of my portfolio works will be added to entice users to want to see the portfolio, they will also be hyperlinks to give them fast access to each work</p>

                        <p>This is an updated wireframe for the essay page. There are two methods I could choose to do. Either place both essays under toggle lists and have them both in one document or each essay will have their own document. I am leaning more towards the latter as it would be more efficient and flexible. Once CSS is allowed, I will experiment with using dropdown menus for my essays and blogs.</p>
