    <h2>Goal and Aesthetic</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the website is to showcase my portfolio of projects to potential collaborators and employers, whilst learning the fundamentals of web development. Users should be able to navigate the website with ease and view what they want with no difficulty. Users should be able to view my portfolio and profile, academic essays, UI design capabilities, and blog posts about various topics regarding technology and development.
        <br>
        The aesthetic I am implementing is a minimilistic template with a black-greyscale color palette. I believe that having a simple template represents my philosophy when in terms of development. It is direct and to the point, whilst remaining within the boundaries of what I am capable of and what is currently in my skillset. I chose this color palette as I prefer to work with colors that i am familiar with, rather than using a mix-match of colors that does not appeal to me. A black-greyscale color palette is flexible and can be aesthetically improved upon with gradient effects.

    <h2>Visual Design Elements</h2>
    <h3>Color</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, the colors used will be pulled from a black-greyscale color palette. This allows for flexible use of the colors and to create a contrasting effect between the background, which is pure black and other parts of the website such as the navigation and footer which are grey. The text remains a distinct white to maintain readability. The a hover color effect is used when the cursor hovers over a selected item in the navigation. This color is a lighter shade of grey. On some index pages, there are hyperlinks to direct the user to the desired page, a fade out gradient effect is used when the cursor hovers above the link as it fades from grey to black. </p>

    <h3>Line</h3>
    <p>Line elements are used throughout the website to signify division or a break in point. The line is drawn from html and fits into the aesthethic of the website. This use of line creates a border between certain sections of the website and creates distinction.</p>

    <h3>Space</h3>
    <p>Space has been used in different methods across the website. In its simplest form its used in a basic manner when it comes to the blog posts. The blog content is provided in text form and the supporting images follow the respective paragraphs. On the portfolio section, space is used more creatively. The background changes to the screenshot of the selected game and information about the game overlaps onto the background image. Other projects are also display but in a card format to preview to the user what it will display. On the Wireframe and IxD pages, the wireframes and its corresponding paragraph are enclosed in a card. Multiple are aligned beside each other and a next button is used to load the next set of wireframes. All documents do follow the same structure however: Heading is followed by the navigation bar, after which will be the content of the page and finally the footer which contains links to profile websites.</p>
