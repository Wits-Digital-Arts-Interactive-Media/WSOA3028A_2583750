        <p1>Hey! I'm Cameron, I'm currently a 3rd year student at the University of Witwatersrand, studying towards a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Arts. My interests include reading, fitness, playing video games and recently I've started to get more involved in the tech industry.</p1>

<h3>Quick Facts About me!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> I'm obsessed with self improvement and always believe I can be better in many aspects, ironically I am also a serial procrastinator but it is improving!</li>
            <li> I'm a minor caffeine addict</li>
            <li> I'm currently on my 4th attempt on trying to bake bread that isn't too hard or raw</li>
            <li> I watch way too many sports that my weekends are always busy</li>
        </ul>
<h3> Goals</h3>
<p2>Academically, my goals are to learn more in terms of development, whether in general software development, game development, or web development. Outside of University, I am also learning additional courses to upskill myself. In my personal life, my current goal is to maintain a stable and healthy balance between academics and personal life and building up healthy habits that will benefit me in the future</p2>
