<h3> Goals</h3>
<p2>Academically, my goals are to learn more in terms of development, whether in general software development, game development, or web development. Outside of University, I am also learning additional courses to upskill myself. In my personal life, my current goal is to maintain a stable and healthy balance between academics and personal life and building up healthy habits that will benefit me in the future</p2>
